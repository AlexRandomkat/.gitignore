STOP POSTING YOUR FRC BINARIES

![STOP POSTING IT](http://i.imgur.com/ekplp0h.jpg)

## What
Stop committing your .class, .jar, and development environment files to GitHub. Not only does it make your repository huge, there's no good reason to track compiled code with git. If you commit your workspace/dev_env files to git, it's probably going to screw up someone's workspace every time they pull.  
  
## Why
If you commit compiled code, stop.
